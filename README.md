# Arbitrary kernel in LIBSVM
This is a fork of LIBSVM which adds support for arbitrary kernels, implemented as an external dynamically loaded library.
(It also incorporates the patch that enables OpenMP multi-core support).
This fork was tested only on OpenSUSE and CentOS.

## New options
`svm-train` recognizes a new value of 5 for option `-t`, which selects the external kernel. It also recognizes two new options, `-l` to specify the file name of the library implementing the kernel and `-x` to specify the parameters for the kernel (e.g. $\gamma$ for the Gaussian Radial Basis Function). The new options are reflected in the model generated by `svm-train` and are recognized by `svm-predict`.

## Dynamic library implementing the kernel
The dynamic library implementing the kernel must expose two functions:

- `void init(const char *)`
- `double kernel(const struct svm_node *, const struct svm_node *)`


`init()` is used to acquire the kernel parameters if any. The string it receives as argument is the one specified via option `-x`.

`kernel()` takes two *objects* and is supposed to return the value of the kernel for those two objects.

You can refer to `tanimotoRbf_kernel.c` is a complete example.

To obtain a library from `tanimotoRbf_kernel.c`, one can use the following commands:
`gcc -fPIC -c -Wall tanimotoRbf_kernel.c`
`gcc -shared tanimotoRbf_kernel.o -Wl,-soname,tanimotoRbf_kernel.1 -o tanimotoRbf_kernel.so.1.0.1 -lc`
